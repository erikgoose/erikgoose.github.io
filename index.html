              <h3>My life</h3>

              <p>Hello everyone, my name is Erik Gustafson. Before I dive
                into discussing my hobbies and interests, I'd like to share
                a bit more about my background. I was born in Waterbury,
                Connecticut, and not long afterward, my family moved to
                Woodbury, CT widely recognized as the antique capital of
                the United States. Growing up as an only child, I found
                that developing a variety of hobbies was essential,
                especially since I didn't have a sibling to annoy. From a
                very young age, I was captivated by golfing, exploring new
                places, attending car shows with my uncle, and eventually,
                I took up weightlifting during my teenage years. Now, as a
                student at the University of Miami, these hobbies have not
                only persisted but continue to shape my daily life and
                passions.
