    <h1>Erik Gustafson</h1>

    <p>Goose Suits is a mens bathing suit brand that not only stands for superb quality, but for freedom of thought, movement, and ability</p>

    <p>The founder and Creative mind behind the Brand Erik Gustafson, has always had a passion for nature. Growing up around Gustafson's Apple Orchard, nature seemed to be the cure from the imposing stress of living in the 21st centuary. With this love for the outdoors, he identified a gap in the marketplace of mens swimwear. Nothing is both affordable and high quality while having a story to root its mission as a company.</p>
